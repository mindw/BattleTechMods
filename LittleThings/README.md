# Little Things

[Battletech Mod][ModTek] Fix some little annoyances and change minor things.

## Highlights
- Fix "Exit/Re-Enter Combat" bug for escort missions (Interleaved Dropouts)
- Fix/Expand Stat Tooltip for Firepower and Durability
    - Shows correct values for stability damage now
    - Respects special gear such as Optimized Capacitors and Ballistic Siege Compensators
    - Shows breakdown of damage depending on weapon type (Energy, Ballistic, Missile, Support)
- Replace hardcoded(!) tooltip descriptions for morale levels
    - Now the values are read from "BaselineAddFromSimGameValues" in CombatGameConstants.json
- Dead or incapacitated actors won't get inspired anymore
- Fixes some annoyances with Coil damage preview
- DFA attacks remove entrenched state from enemy Mechs because it just makes sense
- Disable all additional tutorial slides in "Three years later"
    - And the one for Urban Warfare (Raven introduction)
    - And the one for the added Starmap features
- Suppress Mechwarrior training notification if number of trainable pilots is below a certain limit
    - Vanilla: 2
    - LittleThings: Configurable in settings (default: 4)
- Randomize the 'Mechs fielded for missions "Training Day" and "B-Team"
    - Especially helpful under circumstances where these missions spawn with a very high difficulty
    - At least one Urbie is preserved of course
- Shrink the combat floaties for Structure/Armor-Damage

## Notes
- Disabled "StockIcon" overlay in After Action Report (obsolete with BTG 1.9.0)

- Sanitize some trait descriptions
- Workaround an empty contract list after priority mission on Artru
- Randomize the 'Mechs fielded for missions "Training Day" and "B-Team"
    - Especially helpful under circumstances where these missions spawn with a very high difficulty
    - At least one Urbie is preserved of course
