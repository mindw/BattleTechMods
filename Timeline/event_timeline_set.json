                        "Details": "The War of 3039 was the second war in which the Lyran Commonwealth and Federated Suns would ally. Delayed by bureaucracy and logistical problems, as well as the Skye Crisis, which allowed the Combine to prepare for the war. Many other factors also affected the war effort, such as the fact that the two nations had only a decade to work together and were not able to fully integrate yet. In addition, a cache of Star League-era 'Mechs was given to the Draconis Combine by ComStar, and several elite regiments helped formed and trained by Wolf's Dragoons fought for the Combine forces. In the end, it was a feint by Theodore Kurita that led Hanse Davion to believe his military was stronger than it was that convinced Davion to cease his offensive.\n\nUnlike in the Fourth Succession War, the two nations had some time to integrate their commands, but since only having a decade and a single war where both sides had fought and won together with little interaction would not help the allies in the upcoming war. Though the war, originally planned to happen in less than a few years, turned into a decade as military planners realized that attacking the Draconis Combine would require deception on such an unmanageable scale to conceal troop movements. Unlike the Capellans the Combine leader was not as paranoid of who was planning their certain demise and realized that the recently formed Federated Commonwealth could be the only true threat in the Combine's future. Unbeknownst to ComStar and the Draconis Combine, during the Fourth Succession War a series of devices called Black Boxes, essential in defeating the communication interdiction against the Federated Commonwealth imposed by ComStar during the fourth war, were to be used by FedCom troops to coordinate troop movements but were not. This would have provided a tactical advantage to FedCom troops but was not utilized to their fullest potential as military strategists essentially ignored their usefulness and used the faster Hyperpulse Generators owned by ComStar. This allowed ComStar to warn the DC military to the threat. Unfortunately during the war several of these devices were captured by DC forces and used against FedCom troops.\n\n-- sarna.net",

Small periphery realms disappeared from contact and mercenary units were annihilated (including a detachment from the elite Kell Hounds). In March of 3050, the invaders struck at the Inner Sphere proper. The invaders, known as the Clans, cut a swathe through the Lyran half of the Federated Commonwealth and Draconis Combine and absolutely devastated the Free Rasalhague Republic. Using their technological superiority and impressive combat prowess, over a hundred planets fell in the first year. Four Clans rolled into the Inner Sphere that year. Clans Wolf, Jade Falcon, Smoke Jaguar, and Ghost Bear. While some counterattacks succeeded, they failed to stop their advance.\n\n-- sarna.net",

Largely due to the depth and complexity of their prior clandestine behaviour. Meanwhile, technological development continues at a staggering rate.
