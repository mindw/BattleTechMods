The variant remedied the earlier FLE-14's weaknesses by combining incredible speed with additional armor and weaponry on a 20 ton chassis. The engine was upgraded to a GM 180 in order to reach a similar maximum ground speed of nearly 150 km/h. It mounts two Medium Lasers and an Flamer while retaining an armor profile like the earlier FLE-15.",
