    "Description" : "The Free Rasalhague Republic was a nation born in the wake of the Fourth Succession War, located coreward of Terra. The Free Rasalhague Republic is governed using a system unique to the Inner Sphere and is directly descended from the government of the old Principality of Rasalhague. All positions of power and responsibility are either directly or indirectly elected by the people, even to the Nobles and Prince of the realm. The short term goals of the Republic are to simply survive as a nation. The long term goals involve increasing its military and establishing strong interstellar political alliances so that the FRR is no longer seen as an inviting target of conquest and raiding. The culture of the Free Rasalhague Republic is an amalgam of the original settlers from the Scandinavian regions of old Terra and the Japanese dominated culture of the Draconis Combine that conquered them in the early 24th century. The current leader of the Republic is Prince Magnusson.",
